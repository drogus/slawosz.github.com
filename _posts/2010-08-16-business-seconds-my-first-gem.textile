In June, I have released my first gem, "business seconds":http://github.com/slawosz/business_seconds It is very simple extension for "business time":http://github.com/bokmann/business_time
In my project I needed to count business time in seconds between two time instances. At first, i forked business time, and start implementing my feature, but this is on not todo list in its README. So, I wrote it in separate gem, which has business time in dependencies

I wish my work will help some of You. Enjoy!
