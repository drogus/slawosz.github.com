In June, I have released my first gem, "business seconds":http://github.com/slawosz/business_seconds It is very simple extension for "business time":http://github.com/bokmann/business_time At first, i forked business time, and start implementing my feature, but this is on not todo list in its README. So, I wrote it in separate gem. 

I wish my work will help some of You. Enjoy!
